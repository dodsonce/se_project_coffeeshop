# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. I have had my most success with this project. I was able to do a majority of the project without following the video references. Although, I did have a little help with the help of my friend, Octavio.

## Project features

-   Semantic HTML5
-   Flexbox
-   Positioning
-   Flat BEM file structure
-   A custom form
-   CSS animation and transform
-   NavLinks

## Plan on improving the project

I struggled understanding BEM a bit last sprint and this project kind of forces you to understand. I wish the instructions were a bit more clearer on the breif, especially stage 3. However, that could be my problem since I did struggle a bit with BEM.
